Welcome to Angular-Odyssey a journey through the vast and powerful world of Angular! This repository is my personal space for learning experimenting and building projects as I explore the depths of Angular development.

Hands-on projects and mini-apps showcasing Angular concepts
Code experiments with components services directives and more
Notes, best practices and key takeaways from my learning journey
Debugging the dark forces (a.k.a. bugs & errors)

If you are a Jedi or a Sith in Angular and wish to contribute feel free to open a pull request or share ideas in the issues section.
Join me on this epic coding adventure as I master Angular one component at a time! May the Angular force be with us!
